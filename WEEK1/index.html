            Hello! I'm Akwero Sophia, a passionate web development student from Uganda. 
            I've always been fascinated by how websites work and the technology behind them. 
            When I'm not coding,experimenting with new cooking recipes. I chose to study web development 
            because I believe in the power of creating meaningful online experiences that 
            can help people connect and share information. My goal is to combine my 
            creativity with technical skills to build accessible and user-friendly websites.
